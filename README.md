# About Me
I am a Freshman year student at WTCC and I am currently working on getting a degree in Wed Development. I have prior knowledge of coding such as working in C# and HTML, and I am currently expanding my knowledge of CSS and JavaScript. My interests include art, archival, and some branches of speculation regarding biology and anthropology.

## Websites I would Recommend for Fun
- [This Neocities page](https://thechillzone.neocities.org/home): I usually go to this site when I want to learn more about how people code for more personal sites. Most Neocities sites are best for exploring that. The layout is fun to play with and using the Inspect tool really helps.
- [Tapas.io](https://tapas.io/): This is a site filled with webcomics that I've been visiting for almost 8 years now. I've found multiple great comics here and I encourage you to dig deep into the site to really find the best ones.
